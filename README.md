# Hi there, I'm Iftinca Lucas üëã

I'm a determined Computer Science student currently in **Year 2** at the West University of Timi»ôoara (UVT), focusing on building practical, scalable solutions. I'm actively channeling my studies into real-world projects to prepare for an entry-level role in IT, ideally within **Python Development** or **Automation**.

I believe the most valuable learning happens by **doing**, so I am committed to daily coding and building my professional portfolio.

### üíª My Current Focus & Tech Stack

I am currently working through a 6-month career launch plan to accelerate my entry into the tech industry.

| Category | Skills & Tools | Goals for the Next 6 Months | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **Primary Language** | Python (Basics, OOP, File I/O) | Advanced Python, Flask/Django, OpenAI/Gemini API Integration. | 
| **Web Basics** | HTML5, CSS (Flexbox) | JavaScript fundamentals, building a small web app with a Python backend. | 
| **Developer Tools** | **Git** (Branching, Merging), **GitHub** | Improve version control workflow, contribute to a small open-source project. | 
| **Key Interest** | Automation & AI APIs | Build a functional AI automation tool (e.g., a simple auto-responder). | 

### üå± Projects I'm Working On (Portfolio in Progress)

You can find all my code in my pinned repositories, but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs currently on the build list:

1. **Personal Portfolio Website:** A simple, static page built with HTML/CSS to serve as my **professional digital resume**. (Current Status: Design and deployment in progress via GitHub Pages.)

2. **Expense Tracker CLI App (Python):** A Python Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed to track and manage personal finances. **Focus:** Mastering Python's **OOP principles** and **stable data persistence** using CSV files.

3. **AI Content Generator (Future Project):** A Flask-based web application utilizing a generative **AI API** (e.g., Gemini or OpenAI) to automatically create tailored promotional content. **Focus:** API integration and basic backend architecture.

### ü§ù Let's Connect!

I am actively seeking **part-time internships** or **collaborative projects** to gain professional experience during the upcoming semester (Spring 2026) before the summer break.
